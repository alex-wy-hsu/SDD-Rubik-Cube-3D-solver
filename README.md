# SDD-Rubik-Cube-3D-solver
Spec-Driven Development Rubik’s Cube Solver  A Rubik’s Cube solving tool built with a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach. The cube state, valid moves, constraints, and solving goals are specified first, then implemented and validated incrementally. This project demonstrates applying SDD to algorithmic problem solving.
